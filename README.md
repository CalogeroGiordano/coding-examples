Here are some coding examples for a work portfolio
The files A and B.py work together and grab RGB sensor values from a camera and replicate/create an image from that given data.

The chatbot.py, intents.json and training.py is a whole package that I created. This is a chatot program that users can casually talk to. The goal for this project is eventually
making the bot fully autonomous in its conversing skill while also learning new phrases on its own without having to add the intents myself. The intents json file is a dictionary
that contains different tag subject lines along with phrases to train the bot along with responses with given responses. The chatbot.py file is the main file with helper 
methods to get the chatbot to work.
